v0.3.0 (January ??, 2019)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++


API changes
###########

* The ``param_results`` function does not exist anymore. It has been renamed to
    ``parameter_as_dict`` a time ago but the old name still worked for a while
    along with a ``FutureWarning``
    (`Issue #537 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/537>`_).

New features
############

* Now it is possible to model just one time step. This is important for time step based models and all other models with an outer loop (`Issue #519 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/519>`_).

* Namedtuples and tuples as labels work now without problems. This makes it
    much easier to find objects and results in large energy systems
    (`Issue #507 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/507>`_).

Bug fixes
#########

* The timeincrement attribute of the model is not set to one anymore.
    In earlier versions the timeincrement was set to one by default. This was a
    problem if a wrong time index was passed. In that case the timeincrement
    was set to one without a warning. Now an error is raised if no
    timeincrement or valid time index is found
    (`Issue #549 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/549>`_).

Testing
#######

* Automatic test coverage control was implemented. Now a PR will not be
    accepted if it decreases the test coverage.
* Test coverage was increased to over 90%. A badge was added to the
    `oemof github page <https://github.com/oemof/oemof>`_ that shows the
    actual test coverage.
